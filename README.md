# Customer-Support-Automation

This project uses GPT-2 to generate responses based on frequently asked questions (FAQs) from multiple text files. The responses are generated by combining content from various FAQ datasets.

## Requirements

- Python
- Transformers library
- PyTorch
- JSON files containing FAQs (Some files containing FAQs have been included on which the project was trained and tested.)

## Usage

1. Prepare your FAQ files in JSON format. Each file should contain a list of dictionaries with `question` and `answer` fields. For example:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "question": "Where can I enrol for Aadhaar?",
            "answer": "You have to visit an Aadhaar Enrolment centre set up by Enrolment Agency to enrol for Aadhaar..."
        },
        ...
    ]
    ```
2. Place your FAQ files in the project directory. Update the `text_files` list in the code with the paths to your files.
   
   ```bash
    text_files = [
     #Enter text files here
    ]    
    ```
3. Enter your query in the prompt section.
   
    ```bash
    prompt = "#Enter query here"
    ```

4. Run the script to generate responses based on the combined content of your FAQ files.

## Notes

- Adjust the `max_new_tokens` and `truncation` parameters as needed to control the length and truncation behavior of the generated text.
- Ensure that your FAQ files are properly formatted as JSON.
